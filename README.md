# Hard-Ascents
List of all ascents 9a+ or harder
As a service, all routes 9a+ or harder are also listed. This subset is automatically generated from the list of hard ascents

The dates are written using the ISO 8601: That is YYYY-mm-dd or YYYY-mm if the exact day was not known. Do not edit this file in Google Sheets or Excel as they will automatically change the dates to a non-iso conforming date format (which format exaclty depends on you locale). Edit in Table tool (mac), CSVFileView (win)
