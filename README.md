# Hard-Ascents

List of all ascents 9a+ or harder. No routes 9a/a+ included. No traverses, except for hybrid routes, who are sometimes included for historical reasons.

As a service, all routes 9a+ or harder are also listed. This subset is generated from the list of hard ascents.

The dates are written using the ISO 8601: That is YYYY-mm-dd or YYYY-mm if the exact day was not known. Do not edit this file in Google Sheets or Excel as they will automatically change the dates to a non-iso conforming date format (exactly which format depends on you locale). Edit in Table tool (mac) or CSVFileView (win).

The list was created with help of
